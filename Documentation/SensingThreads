Materials
1/16” silicone tubing 

Techtronic Silver Multi-plated Electroplated Thread

Loop Needle Threader 




Step 1: Assemble 1 Set
Silicone Tubing per 7 joint arm (1 set ):
2x Short Tubes: 1 ft length
2x Long Tubes: 2 ft length 


Step 2: Electroplated thread & silicone tube

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4u4TohxgXU

*note* Once inserted thread enough through tubing, tie overhand knot on one end (with both tube & thread portion)
Proceed with the video tutorial, once completely inserted
Tie 2nd overhand knot on the opposite end 
Cut end threads down to 1”
Repeat 4x
*note* For the long tubes: must mark tube w/ sharpie for “sensing portion” (= same length as small tubes you cut)
Tie overhand knots where sharpie marked







Step 3: Joint placement – 2 short threaded tubes 

Short Tubes 2x: (joints 1-4) Place one end rightmost or leftmost joint groove and extend into the next 4 joint grooves (straight)
At the 4th joint, wrap tube around, under, and then over the groove of only the 4th joint so that the other end loops back (across the 3 other joints) to start point 
Ziptie and secure both ends
Note: if done correctly, both ends of tube should finish on the top face of 1-3 joint grooves
Repeat again for the other side groove 
Recall: leave middle 2 grooves of joints 1-4 empty 


Step 4: Joint placement – 2 long threaded tubes 
2x long tubes, middle 2 grooves of joints 1-7
Repeat same steps for short tubes (see Step 3) but loop under over the 7th (last joint) and come back
Sensing portion of tube should align over joints #3-7
ZipTie and secure ends 



All Done !
