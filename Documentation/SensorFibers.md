This is a tutorial on how to make the sensor fibers we use for our robotic strap

MATERIALS
1. <img src="images\silicontubing.png" alt="Silicone Tubing" width="50%" height=auto>
We will need several feet of 1/16" silicone tubing.

2. <img src="images\electroplatedthread.png" alt="Electroplated Thread" width="50%" height=auto>
Secondly we require Techtronic Silver Multi-plated electroplated thread.

3. <img src="images\loopneedlethreader.png" alt="Loop needle threader" width="50%" height=auto>
Finally, to insert our thread into our tubes, we will need the above needle.

ASSEMBLY

1. Assemble 1 set: we need to assemble one set of tubes. This means we are making enough sensors for a standard 7 joint arm strap. Then measure two 1ft tubes for our short tubes, and two 2ft tubes for the long tubes. 

2. Electroplated Thread and Silicone Tube: 
Use the following youtube tutorial alongside reading this tutorial:

Link Sonia Tutorial Video: How to Thread electroplated thread → through the inside of silicone tubing 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4u4TohxgXU
    
    1. *note* Once inserted thread far enough through tubing, tie overhand knot on one end (with both tube & thread portion)
    2. Proceed with the video tutorial, once completely inserted
    3. Tie 2nd overhand knot on the opposite end 
    4. Cut end threads down to 1”
    5. Repeat 4x
    6. *note* For the long tubes: must mark tube w/ sharpie for “sensing portion” (= same length as small tubes you cut)
        a. Tie overhand knots where sharpie marked
You should get the following once completed:

3. JOINT PLACEMENT - 2 SHORT THREADED TUBES

    1. Short Tubes 2x: (joints 1-4) Place one end rightmost or leftmost joint groove and extend into the next 4 joint grooves (straight)
    2. At the 4th joint, wrap tube around, under, and then over the groove of only the 4th joint so that the other end loops back (across the 3 other joints) to start point 
    3. Ziptie and secure both ends
    4. Note: if done correctly, both ends of tube should finish on the top face of 1-3 joint grooves
    5. Repeat again for the other side groove 
    6. Recall: leave middle 2 grooves of joints 1-4 empty 

4. JOINT PLACEMENT - 2 LONG THREADED TUBES

2x long tubes, middle 2 grooves of joints 1-7

<img src="images\finished.png" alt="Placement of long tubes" width="50%" height=auto>

    1. Repeat same steps for short tubes (see Step 3) but loop under over the 7th (last joint) and come back
    2. Sensing portion of tube should align over joints #3-7
    3. ZipTie and secure ends 

All done!
